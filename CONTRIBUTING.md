# Contribution

## I saw your "hilarious" project and I wanted to contribute.  What would you like help with?

[Check the issues page](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/hitme/issues) for known issues and things to do.  If you have an idea for a new issue, make a new issue with the `New Issue` button.

## I heard/read/thought of a joke that would be a good fit for the jokes.txt file.  Can I contribute?

Make a new issue or pull request if you have a new joke.  See the jokes.txt file for examples of other jokes and the syntax for adding new lines.

Dad, popsicle, and anti jokes will be considered a higher priority than other jokes.  All jokes must adhere to the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.  Sexual, racial, offensive, and insulting jokes will not be considered.  If you want to fork the project and go in a different direction, I ask that you remove my name before doing so.
